                    Abstract</h5>
                <p>
                    This paper presents an in-depth user experience (UX) research study focused on developing a new
                    greenfield educational application designed to serve parents, students, teachers, administrators,
                    and school superintendents. The platform integrates multiple functionalities, including a gradebook,
                    class schedules, assignment tracking, and dual-portal access. Through extensive human-centered
                    design
                    principles and psychological insights, the research involved interviewing over 100 educational
                    professionals
                    and conducting iterative user testing throughout the development process. The findings informed a
                    user-centered
                    design that addresses the complex cognitive and emotional needs of diverse stakeholders in the
                    educational ecosystem.

                    Introduction</h5>
                <p>
                    The rapid digitization of education necessitates platforms that are not only functionally efficient
                    but
                    also psychologically attuned to the needs of their users. Traditional educational software often
                    overlooks
                    the cognitive load and emotional experiences of its users, leading to frustration and reduced
                    effectiveness.
                    This study aims to bridge that gap by applying human-centered design and psychological principles to
                    develop
                    an integrated educational platform with distinct views for students, teachers, and administrators.

                    Background and Objectives
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Existing educational platforms frequently suffer from a lack of integration and an overemphasis on
                    technical
                    features at the expense of user experience. The objective of this UX research was to identify the
                    psychological
                    and practical pain points in current systems and design an application that provides seamless,
                    empathetic
                    interaction among all stakeholders. Key features include a unified gradebook, class schedules,
                    assignment due
                    dates, and a dual-portal system for accessing information from different entities.
